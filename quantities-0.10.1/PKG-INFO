Description: Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and
            conversions of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality
            specified by various units, and possibly an uncertainty. See the tutorial_
            for examples. Quantities builds on the popular numpy library and is
            designed to work with numpy ufuncs, many of which are already
            supported. Quantities is actively developed, and while the current features
            and API are stable, test coverage is incomplete so the package is not
            suggested for mission-critical applications.
